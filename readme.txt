Small wrapper on OpenGL objects created for educational purpose.

Two applications:
sandbox is a playground for testing some engine features
test_task is a program that demonstates some UI and plot rendering

Dependencies:
GLFW, GLM, GLEW libraries getting from Hunter package manager
DevIL library temporary should be added manually :(

Linux build requires some packages: xorg-dev, libdevil-dev
(in worst case libraries libglfw3-dev, libglew-dev could be acquired from apt-get instead of Hunter)
